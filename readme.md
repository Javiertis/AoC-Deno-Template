# DENO AOC2021

A simple but effective template for Advent of Code.

You should have [deno](https://deno.land/#installation) installed.

Also you have to set the cookie
[(link on how to get it)](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1)
on the [cookie.ts](./utils/cookie.ts) file.

Just make the runProblems.sh file executable and run it.

```bash
chmod +x runProblem.sh
```

To run both problems, run:

```bash
./runProblem.sh <day>
```

To run just a part of the problem, just add the second parameter.

```bash
./runProblem.sh <day> <problem>
```

If you want make more days, just create a folder following the pattern of the
given one.
